For the printFire program, I will modify the couts to print the numbers in each
temperature list, then feed the temp array consecutive integers from my test.txt file to make sure all numbers are being read and printed correctly

For my calcTemp array, I will create a unit test program that feeds calcTemp lists with small and easily checkable int pairs, then print the temp outputs to make sure they are being added and stored properly in the temperature list

For unBurntCarb, I will similarly feed the lists small, countable ints, and then verify the carbon is being transfered up through the fire properly.

For my avg O2 function, I will similarly feed the function small, easily verifiable ints and print the outputs of the resultant 02 levels to make sure they are being calculated inside the funciton properly.

P.S. I don't know how to write unit-test driver programs and spent too much time getting the fire to look cool so I will be turning this portion of the assignment in incomplete. Sorry!
